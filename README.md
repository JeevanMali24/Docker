Hardware vertulazation
- suppose we have a hardware which contain memory of 20gb and want to install any software which requirds any 500mb, but we uable to install software because the memory has been accoupied by windows 10gb and linux 10gb
- this is what happen in hardware vertulazation
- to over come the drow back of hardware vertulazation we can use os level vertulazation

Os vertulazation
- in os vertulazation we can reuse the memory resources but in case of hardware level vertulazation we can't use memory once it allocated.
