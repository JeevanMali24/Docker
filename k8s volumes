volumes:
containers are short lived in nature 

all data stored inside a container is deleted if container crashes..

to overcome this problem k8s uses volumes, a volume is a essentially directory used for storage medium . th storage medium and its content are deteremined
by volume type...

in k8s volumes volume is attached to a pod and shared among the containers of that pod....

the volume has same life span as the pod....

volume types: 

a volume types decides the properties of directory like size,content etc... 

volume types-

node-local types such as a a)emptydir
                           b)hostpath
                           c)nfs
                           d)elastic block store (EBS-cloud provided volume)


emptydir: 

use this when we want to share contents between multiple containers on smae pod and not to the host machine

an empty dir volume is first created when pod assigned to node and exists as long as that pod is running on that node...

as name says initially it is empty

once pod is created and data inside a container will map with this directory 

in short empty dir is backup for that directory data...

if directory crashes volume data as it is no any effect on data

but if pod is crashes all the data inside volume will be deleted....
